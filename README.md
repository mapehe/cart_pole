# cart_pole

A simple script for solving OpenAI Gym's [CartPole-v0](https://gym.openai.com/envs/CartPole-v0).
While there [already are](http://karpathy.github.io/2016/05/31/rl/) excellent tutorials on reinforcement
learning in general, I had trouble finding one I liked that uses TensorFlow's automatic differentiation instead of
tinkering with the gradients by hand.

I discuss the details of this script in [a post](https://mapehe.github.io/Cart-Pole/).
